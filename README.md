# Overview

**PiX** is simple image editor written in Java's Swing, with several image processing tools available to the user.

Currently available tools are:
* modifying the HSB (Hue, Saturation, Brightness) components of the image
* determining the average color of the loaded image
* inverting image colors

In case the user decides to use the "HSB Changer" tool, the end result might look something like this:

After applying tool(s) on the image, the user can choose to save the obtained result by exporting the edited image.

PiX is still under development and will periodically be equipped with more tools in the future...
